O no, no, I never go to work
On Mondays, I never go to work
On Tuesdays, I stay at home
On Wednesdays, I'm never feeling fine
Work is the last thing on my mind

On Thursdays, it's a holiday
And Fridays I detest
Oh, it's much too late on a Saturday
And Sunday is the day of rest

O yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday
Practice Monday
Practice Tuesday
Practice Wednesday
Practice Thursday
And Friday
And I practice all night on Saturday
So Sundays I play best
